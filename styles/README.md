Code Style
==========

Rosetta intends to follow the Google code styles, as
outlined 

https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html
https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml

For users of intellij, both styles can be applied using
intellij-java-google-style.xml. For users of eclipse,
the eclipse-java-google-style.xml applies to java files,
while eclipse-cpp-google-style.xml applies to javascript
files (as suggested [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml#Code_formatting)).

The only modification made to these styles has been that
indentation rules set to two spances have been increased
to four spaces.
