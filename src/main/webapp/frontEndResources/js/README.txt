This directory contains all the client-side scripts used by Rosetta.

3rd-party (not developed here) scripts are contained in their own individual folders.  Any
add-on or custom functions/scripts associated with the 3rd-party packages are located in the 
respective directories and denoted as custom.js or in a custom subdirectory.

These scripts are loaded via jsp include from the WEB-INF/views/jspf/common/javascript.jspf file.
