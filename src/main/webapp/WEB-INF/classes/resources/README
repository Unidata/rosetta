This directory contains xml files that are read by Spring as a Resource (see Spring Resource Interface).
Contents of the xml files are read in and loaded into the database during application initialization.
This information is added to the Model to be used by the View.  The corresponding View files will display
the data contained in these files.

To add a Resource to be used in the View:

1) Make your own XML file.  NOTE: Be sure that the allotted data type in the corresponding database table
   is sufficient to hold the text data without truncation.  Platform, Community, and & FileType data currently
   has a max length of 255 characters. Modify the database table data type if one of these text entries exceeds
   255 characters.
2) Modify the edu.ucar.unidata.rosetta.service.resource.EmbeddedDerbyDbInitManager class in the to add database
   table creation and population of those tables.
3) If adding a new METADATA PROFILE, either:
       a) add is to one of the existing profile directories; OR
       b) add a new profile directory and modify edu.ucar.unidata.rosetta.init.resources.MetadataProfileLoader to
          read the data in that directory.
4) Document your new file in index.xml.  NOTE: Order matters here in the index.xml file! The resources in that file
   will be loaded into the database in the order in which they appear. If a resource depends upon or references
   another, the dependency resource MUST be loaded first
5) Create a corresponding domain object in edu.ucar.unidata.domain.resources for your resource.
6) Add the appropriate JSTL in the corresponding View file.
