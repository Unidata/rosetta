This directory contains xml files that are read by Spring as a Resource  (see Spring Resoure Interface).
Contents of the xml files are read in and placed in the Model to be used by the View.  The corresponding
View files will display the data contained in these files.  

To add a Resource to be used in the View:

1) Have a look at the TemplateController.java to see how these fiels are parsed.
2) Make your own XML file. 
3) Document your new file in index.xml.
4) Add the appropriate JSTL in the corresponding View file.
